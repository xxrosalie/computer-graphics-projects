# Computer Graphics Projects
For my computer graphics class, we had to complete four coding projects where each project kept building on top of eachother when it comes to difficulty and use of different concepts. I used concepts such as raytracing, rasterization, shaders, textures, and transformations.

## Program 1
Program 1 consisted of using ray casting to render lit boxes. To do this, I used Blinn-Phong illumination. In the first image here, you see the boxes. In the second image I created a heart out of multiple of these boxes.

## Program 2
Program 2 consisted of using WebGL to render some simple triangles. This also consisted of coding shaders and using index buffers. The first image shows the simple triangles that could be rendered using my code. The second image also consists of only triangles, but I turned it into a sunset scene.

## Program 3
Program 3 was a bit more complex. It still required rendering triangles, but now the triangles are able to be transformed or rotated and the view is able to be changed as well. It is not clear to see in these images, but each individual triangle or square can be moved with keys on the keyboard and the view/eye can also be moved with keys on the keyboard. You are also able to select a single triangle and rotate or move only one triangle at a time. The first image is the simple scene of triangles. The second image is an avocado that was made from converting an OBJ file to a JSON file with some simple code. That JSON file then was used to render an avocado. It looks a little crazy because the entire scene is green and the light lights up parts of the avocado.

## Program 4
Program 4 shows rendering with textures now. It also shows the use of transparency and lighting. The same transformations as program 3 are still possible as well. Now there are also ellipsoids besides only triangles. In the first image, you see the triangles and ellipsoids rendered with their textures. The second image shows that, but now with transparency and lighting turned on. The bottom two images show that too, but now with a christmas scene that I made when playing around with different textures and overlapping textures.

## Program 5
Program 5 is a video game. I made the game battlezone. It is an old arcade game, which is why I made it with vector graphics. In the game, you must press the arrow buttons to move yourself. You are a tank. You can move around the battlefield which has mountains in the back and obstacles throughout the field. You cannot go through obstacles and your bullets also cannot. There are enemy tanks also walking throughout the battlefield. You are supposed to shoot them (by pressing the spacebar) before they shoot you. Every time you hit an enemy tank, it gets killed, you get 250 points added to your score, and a new enemy tank spawns somewhere randomly on the battlefield. Every 5 seconds there is a chance that an enemy tank will face you and shoot perfectly at you, so you must move to dodge the bullet. The game and score continues until you die. You die by getting hit by an enemy tank. If you get hit once, your score goes back down to 0 and you are reset at the spot where the initial game began.   
The game shows your score in the top left corner. It also shows a radar in the top right. This radar shows dots of where enemy tanks are if they are in your view.

I also made a second view of the game where the elements of the game are made with OBJ models instead of vector graphics. As of right now, the models are plainly colored, but once I have more time, I want to put in the textures that I made for them. My goal was to make it candyland, as I made hot pink tanks, snowy pink mountains, and lillipops as obstacles, but right now that is not fully visible. I will show what the game looks like right now and pictures of the models that I made.

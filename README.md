# Computer Graphics Projects
For my computer graphics class, we had to complete four coding projects where each project kept building on top of eachother when it comes to difficulty and use of different concepts. I used concepts such as raytracing, rasterization, shaders, textures, and transformations.

## Program 1
Program 1 consisted of using ray casting to render lit boxes. To do this, I used Blinn-Phong illumination. In the first image here, you see the boxes. In the second image I created a heart out of multiple of these boxes.

## Program 2
Program 2 consisted of using WebGL to render some simple triangles. This also consisted of coding shaders and using index buffers. The first image shows the simple triangles that could be rendered using my code. The second image also consists of only triangles, but I turned it into a sunset scene.

## Program 3
Program 3 was a bit more complex. It still required rendering triangles, but now the triangles are able to be transformed or rotated and the view is able to be changed as well. It is not clear to see in these images, but each individual triangle or square can be moved with keys on the keyboard and the view/eye can also be moved with keys on the keyboard. You are also able to select a single triangle and rotate or move only one triangle at a time. The first image is the simple scene of triangles. The second image is an avocado that was made from converting an OBJ file to a JSON file with some simple code. That JSON file then was used to render an avocado. It looks a little crazy because the entire scene is green and the light lights up parts of the avocado.

## Program 4
Program 4 shows rendering with textures now. It also shows the use of transparency and lighting. The same transformations as program 3 are still possible as well. Now there are also ellipsoids besides only triangles. In the first image, you see the triangles and ellipsoids rendered with their textures. The second image shows that, but now with transparency and lighting turned on. The bottom two images show that too, but now with a christmas scene that I made when playing around with different textures and overlapping textures.

## Program 5
Program 5 is still in progress, but I am creating the game battlezone in JavaScript, using the techniques I learned in program 1-4.

First look at a part of the implemented project:

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- VSCode
- HTML
- JSON

## Challenges
- Having to complete large coding projects in a language I never learned
- Learning computer graphics concepts at a fast pace and having to implement them immediately
- Understanding the computer graphics concepts
- The math behind computer graphics

## Accomplishments
- Learned so much more about computer graphics: how it works, how to code it
- Discovered that I love turning logic into a visual image with code
- Enhanced my problem-solving skills
- Practiced coding in JavaScript
